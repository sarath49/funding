# Funding
*******

The goal of this project is to enable people to post their crowdfunding information (Patreon, OpenCollective, etc) without needing to allow script tags. Our first customer will be Drupal.org (we hope).

The discussion for this iteration of the project started when github announced their FUNDING.yml file - I know there are some Drupal projects that have this file in their repo. In addition to open source software projects like Drupal modules or initiatives, we would also like to serve local or virtual user groups - local Drupal user groups or anyone who uses Drupal and one of these ongoing crowdfunding platforms.

## What will this module provide?

* A field formatter for link fields to render an open collective widget
* A Configurable block to display open collective widgets not attached to a node
* Future plan: A Drush command to find crowdfunding links in module.info files
* Future plan: A Composer plugin to find crowdfunding links in composer.json files

Is there a particular crowdfunding service you'd like to see supported? Jump into the issue queue and send us a patch!

Supported by the [Portland Drupal Users Group](https://opencollective.com/portland-drupal).
